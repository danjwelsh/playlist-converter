# Playlist Converter
#### Convert Apple Music to Plain Text

This is a tool to format exported playlists from Apple Music to a more readable format for
conversion services like [playlist-converter](http://www.playlist-converter.net/#/).

I used this to transfer playlists from Apple Music to Spotify.

## Run
*Requires NPM*

Export your Apple Music playlists as text files and save them in the folder `playlists`.

Run the command:
```bash
npm run
```

Your shiny new formatted playlists are now in `converted-playlists` 🔥👌🏻💿
